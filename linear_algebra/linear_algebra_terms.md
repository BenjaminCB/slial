**Nullspace:** The solution set to a homogeneous equation (Ax = 0) is called the nullspace.

**Image:** The image is where a vector lands after it has been transformed. You would say image of v under multiplication by A.

**Eigenvector:** Vector that when transformed is a scalar multiple of itself.

**Eigenvalue:** Above mentioned scalar. 

**Eigenspace:** The solution set to the equation (A-lamda * I)x = 0, is called the eigenspace of A, and can be multidimensional.

**Strictly dominant eigenvalue:** Means that its absolute value is larger than all other eigenvalues for the transformation. Strictly larger >, no >=.
